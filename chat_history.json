I've successfully created a comprehensive React Native app that displays global death statistics with the following features:\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **App Overview**\n\nThe app provides real-time global death statistics with a clean, modern interface designed for both iOS and Android.\n\n## \ud83d\udcf1 **Key Features**\n\n### **Main Dashboard (`app/index.tsx`)**\n- **Real-time death counters** that update every second\n- Statistics broken down by seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, and years\n- **Live calculations** showing deaths since the start of each time period\n- Global death rate information\n- Navigation to other screens\n\n### **Countries Screen (`app/countries.tsx`)**\n- **Ranked list of countries** by death rate (deaths per 1,000 people per year)\n- **Search functionality** to find specific countries\n- **Filter by region** (Europe, Asia, North America, etc.)\n- Country flags, population data, and estimated annual deaths\n- Real-world data for 35+ countries\n\n### **Statistics Screen (`app/statistics.tsx`)**\n- **Detailed global population dynamics** for the current year\n- **Birth vs death comparisons** with net population growth\n- **Leading causes of death** with percentages and estimated numbers\n- **Daily averages** and comprehensive demographic insights\n\n### **About Screen (`app/about.tsx`)**\n- Information about the app's features and data sources\n- Disclaimers about data accuracy\n- Credits to WHO, UN, World Bank, and other data sources\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 **Design Features**\n\n- **Light theme** with clean, modern aesthetics\n- **Smooth animations** and transitions between screens\n- **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes\n- **Intuitive navigation** with back buttons and clear visual hierarchy\n- **Color-coded statistics** (red for deaths, green for births, blue for growth)\n- **Card-based layout** with subtle shadows and proper spacing\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **Technical Implementation**\n\n- **Real-time updates** using `setInterval` for live counters\n- **File-based routing** with Expo Router\n- **TypeScript** for type safety\n- **Reusable components** (StatisticsCard, LoadingSpinner, etc.)\n- **Proper state management** with React hooks\n- **Optimized performance** with proper component structure\n\n## \ud83d\udcca **Data & Statistics**\n\nThe app uses realistic global mortality statistics:\n- **~1.8 deaths per second globally**\n- **~155,000 deaths per day**\n- **~57 million deaths per year**\n- Country-specific death rates based on real WHO/UN data\n- Leading causes of death with accurate percentages\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 **Navigation Flow**\n\n1. **Main Dashboard** \u2192 View real-time death counters\n2. **Countries** \u2192 Compare death rates by country\n3. **Statistics** \u2192 Detailed demographic analysis  \n4. **About** \u2192 App information and data sources\n\nThe app provides a comprehensive, educational tool for understanding global mortality patterns while maintaining a respectful and informative approach to this sensitive topic.
